applyTo: "plan/**"

Purpose
- Phased implementation plans with acceptance criteria and contracts.
- Used when project requires multiple independent work streams or formal handoff governance.
- Alternative to `ideas.md` for larger, multi-team projects.

Rules
- Reference sequencing, entry/exit criteria, dependencies, and risks.
- Keep `overview.md` as source of truth for governance and conventions when present.
- If `ideas.md` exists in repository root, it supersedes the plan/ folder structure as the single source of truth.

Checklist
- [ ] Phases defined
- [ ] Acceptance criteria per phase
- [ ] Dependencies and risks documented
- [ ] Status/owner/dates kept current
- [ ] No conflicts with ideas.md if both exist (prefer ideas.md)
